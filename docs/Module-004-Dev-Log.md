#### Goals for this Module

- [ ] Complete Color Theory Case Study
- [ ] Rework card game ideas


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Completed color theory case study
  - Generated some new ideas for card game
  
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Difficulty balancing card game, coming up with innovative mechanics
  - Making the Color Theory designs work
  
- **Solutions**:
  - For Color Theory, tried a few ideas and then took a step back to evaluate
    - Some interesting insights stemmed from the different attempts
  - For the card game, moving from a classic deck to cards with abilities
    - May be more complicated, but will allow me to better prototype and expand 

#### Learnings
- Not every first idea is a good idea
- Colors can sometimes do the opposikte of your intention
  - asking for a second opinion or stepping away from your work can give you new a perspective
#### Free Thinking
- I want to make an aesthetically cool game, in conjunction with interesting mechanics.
- However, I am realizing that there is a lot of creative freedom working off of the idea of a basic deck of cards.
  - where before moves were abstract, I can now give them reasons for working, which sometimes improve the brainstorming process, or give me ideas for new abilities or cards

#### Next Steps
