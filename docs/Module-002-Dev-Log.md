#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Complete the case study
- [ ] Choose an idea for the game design
- [ ] Flesh out the game idea with some preliminary rules.

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Completed Atari Game case study
  -- Got some references from Atari to keep in mind for my game 
  - Brainstormed ideas for the game design project
  
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Originality in designing a game
  - Trying to innovate on other games without taking too much or too little.
  
- **Solutions**:
  - Simplified my sights for the game, aiming to fulfill a goal rather than try to make something great from the start
  - Took at look at other games of its kind, mainly the games Spades and Hearts
  

#### Learnings
- Inspiration doesn't always lead to the most valuable or feasible ideas, sometimes it's an idea farther down the list that works better.
- Making sure the game is fun comes quickly, I'm working on not getting too complex or too simple to try and make gameplay feel rewarding

#### Free Thinking
- My current design hinges on using a basic deck of cards, which can be more difficult to scale to a multiplayer game. Most notably, if I want to make the suits have unique properties, I must find a way to balance the number of cards in the pool of each type.
- Innovating on the standard deck is difficult, so what if I separate the suits to have different purposes?
- Having multiple players is also an issue, as the number of players increases, the average number of cards goes down, meaning the game has to scale to meet this


#### Next Steps
- I'm going to continue looking at other examples, and seeing how other games approach the balance and scalability problems, to help me come up with my own ideas.
- When I have more ideas, I plan to utilize my friends to help me test my ideas and get feedback on whether or not my ideas are working.
