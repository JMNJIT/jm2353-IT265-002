#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Complete the case study
- [ ] Choose an idea for the game design
- [ ] Flesh out the game idea with some preliminary rules.

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Completed Atari Game case study
    - took a few ideas from how Atari succeeded into my mindset for creating the game
  - Brainstormed ideas for the game designn project
  
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Originality in designing a game
  - Innovating on gameplay with traditional tools and pieces (52 cards)
  
- **Solutions**:
  - Simplified my sights for the game, aiming to fulfill a goal rather than try to make something great from the start
  - Looked back at other references doing similar things, such as the standard game of Hearts or Spades
  

#### Learnings
- Inspiration doesn't always lead to the most valuable or feasible ideas, sometimes it's an idea farther down the list that works better.
- Making sure the game is fun will preceed importance, so I shouldn't try to overcomplicate it, as a well-designed simple mechanic can be the same if not more fun than a poorly-designed complex one

#### Free Thinking
- My current design hinges on using a basic deck of cards, which can be more difficult to scale to a multiplayer game. Most notably, if I want to make the suits have unique properties, I must find a way to balance the number of cards in the pool of each type.
- Since it's difficult to innovate on a standard deck of cards, what if I separate the suits and give them unique purposes?
- Having multiple players is also an issue, as the number of players increases, the average number of cards goes down, meaning the game has to scale to meet this


#### Next Steps
- I'm going to continue looking at other examples, and seeing how other games approach the balance and scalability problems, to help me come up with my own ideas.
- I plan to use my friends to help me determine if the ideas I come up with are fun, and get feedback on how I can improve the game
