#### Goals for this Module
- Continue to Iterate on game design idea
- Work on aesthetics

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Continuing generating ideas for card game
  - Style / Theme chosen: the game's title is Fire Fight, and will be a group turn- and goal-based game
  - Some more ideas on how I want the gameplay loop to be, including normal gameplay turns and a "fire fight," where two players duel to win cards to progress a goal
  - Fighting style cards which will dictate how a player can act during the fight phase

- **Challenges faced**:
  - Balancing, originality
  - Still feel like it is in the formation stage, I really like the theme and some planned elements, but getting there is another battle


- **Solutions**:
  - Still working on the ideas, I would like to take some elements similar to the games FLUXX, Exploding Kittens, and Unstable Unicorns, but trying to make sure it is not a true rip is difficult/


#### Learnings
- Even though I am thinking of using familiar mechanics, the theme really does make a difference. Thus far, I do not think there is a game like this

#### Free Thinking
- How will I balance the game for more than a few sizes of players? I want the goals to be collecting and "burning" cards to achieve something, 
  but I don't know how to keep the number of ability cards and collectible cards balanced for scalability


#### Next Steps
- Keep working on the mechanical balance
- Draw up some ideas, get the theme down in some art to help the formation continue
