#### Goals for this Module

- [ ] Start work on digital prototype
- [ ] continue to iterate Fire Fight


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I am still trying to organize the way I expect the card game to work, as the chain reaction aspects are still a little difficult<!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - I'm still approaching the way that I will define the rounds and how certain cards will take priority. <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - So far I think I will have a global loop run to check for each type of action in a sequence, such as after a card is played, check for if another card needs to be burned to use it, then check for on-play effects, etc.
  - This is still a little hard to conceptualize how the sequence will work, but it's getting there <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Even with the simple rules / emergence pipeline, it still needs to have enough structure that it stays together, and that all checks can be made. <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  There's a lot that still needs to get built, but the lectures are addressing a lot of the problems i'm finding. I'll continue to organize my thoughts and then I'll hit the problems one by one. <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- One of the biggest things I'm worried about are cards that "jump in" during another player's turn. I'm pushing these off for now, but it's something that will come up soon
