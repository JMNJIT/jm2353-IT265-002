#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Discuss Poor Aspects of Games
- [ ] Continue developing ideas for game
- [ ] Think about implementation of game


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Came up with some core gameplay ideas / changes 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Balancing mechanics is difficult
- **Solutions**:
  - Continuing to vary style and player moves / options during their turn
  - Still working on solutions to this

#### Learnings
-  Managing player abilities is difficult, seems like many games achieve balance by compounding more and more counter abilities
  
#### Free Thinking
- For my game, I want there to be a trick / hidden aspect, but also the ability to influence other players, such that in order to win, ou have to plan ahead well and also make good logical decisions.
- Most games do this by either making our number of moves very small, or very large, so in order to compromise this, I think I will make players limited to one move, but either allow them to access any player or pick from a variety of cards to make their move.
- I would also like to give players a defensive move, such as preventing one card from being taken from them

#### Next Steps
-  I have to keep iterating, I still think my current loop is too easy to target one player, and has too many cards that are in excess during a given turn.
-  Once I make a few changes, I'm going to play a round of it myself, before moving on to player testing.
