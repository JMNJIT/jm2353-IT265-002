#### Goals for this Module

- [ ] work on digital prototype
- [ ] complete case study



#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I started laying out the prefabs for the card game. 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  I'm still working on the mat and socket structures for the game, since i'm still struggling a bit with the cards as classes and the interactions they will have
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  I'm going to take som inspiration from your ideas, but i do want to make the code/classes my own

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  I'm going to omit some features, since I think jump-ins and out-of-turn effects will be simply too complicated for the timespan

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I like the socketing elements, where they will just pop into place. I'm wondering if I might be able to make the cards sort of float around before snapping into place, but i'm still not sure how i might do that 

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Next up is the coding, creating the classes and data structures to house the cards

* Full disclosure that you can probably see for yourself with the creation date of this page, I messed up and did not save my changes last night. Had a pretty bad headache and didn't do my usual double-check on the URL working.
