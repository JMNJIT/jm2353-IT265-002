## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics
<!-- 
List and describe the core gameplay mechanics players will engage with. 
Explain how they contribute to the game's challenge and fun. 
-->

**Cores** - Each player is given a Core card, and a number of tokens attached to it (balanced for number of players). A player is eliminated if they have no tokens remaining. 

**Embers** - Item cards which can have special effects. These are played from the hand face up in front of a player, with a maximum per player cap of 5 (Subject to change with prototype balancing). These cards will often be used as fuel for certain attack or event cards, and may be "burned" by Fire Fights and other players' effect cards.

**Events** - Cards which alter the flow of play. This may include altering the rules for the round, forcing a player to take a specific action, or drawing or discarding certain cards. These can be beneficial or harmful, and will state what their course of action is.  

**Allies** - Each player can have 1 ally card in play, which will provide special bonuses while active. These are placed face up in front of a player when played, and must remain separate from Ember cards. Allies persist through rounds, so long as the player survives. 

**Tarot** - Event cards with place specific restrictions or rule changes to the gameplay. Can be removed for simpler gameplay loop (i.e. boring people). Unless otherwise stated, only one Tarot card may be active at a time.

**Fire Fight (Duel)** - At the end of the round, if not during a grace round, the leading player may choose a target, initiating a 1-on-1 exchange of cards. Based on the player's Fighting Style card, they may be able to take different actions, such as playing items, attacks, drawing cards, or exchanging cards. There is only one duel per round, and once all card effects are resolved, play continues with the next player becoming the leading player for that round.

**Protection Token** - To prevent targeting, the player last aggressed upon by a Fire fight is granted a token, which prevents them from being targeted before another player is first. If the player leads the round, they may still choose to be an aggressor.

**Winning the Game** - Players will win by default if all other players are defeated, by exhausting the tokens on their Core. However, certain Event cards may allow a secondary condition to be met first, securing victory in another way. This may be done by collecting a set of embers, winning a certain number of Fire Fights, or playing certain cards.



### Goals and Challenges
<!-- 
Detail what players aim to achieve and the obstacles they must overcome. 
Explain how these challenges drive player engagement. 
-->
Players will first aim to be the last one standing. In the final version of the game, some Tarot cards may change this objective.
Players will be challenged by numerous trade-offs and unpredictabiliy, as card effects may stack, cascade, or alter the flow of play suddenly.

### Progression
<!-- 
Describe how the gameplay evolves over time. 
Are there new abilities, unlockable levels, skill trees, or difficulty scaling? 
-->
More event cards and evetually Tarot cards will work their way into the game, creating dynamic shifts in goals and strategies as the game goes on. 

If the game is reduced to 2 players, some mechanics will change to make finishing the game easier.
- The Roasted Token will be removed.
- Players Must engage in a Fire Fight at the end of the Round

### Game Rules
<!-- 
Outline the core rules governing the gameplay experience. 
Ensure they are clear, structured, and intuitive. 
-->
- The first round is a grace period, where no Fire Fights can be started
-- The leading player does not change in between the first and second round 

- Players may not have more than 3 Embers at a time unless a card states otherwise
- Players may have 0 or 1 ally active at a time
- Whenever a player plays a card that they are at capacity for, they must burn (discard) a chosen card of the type, resolve its effects, and replace it with a new card.

- Players can always begin their turn by drawing 3 cards
- Players can play any number of cards during their turn, excluding most attack cards.
- When a player is finished playing their cards, play moves to the next player Clockwise
