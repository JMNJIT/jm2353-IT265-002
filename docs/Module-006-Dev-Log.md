#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
-->
- [ ] Finish Design treatment
- [ ] Draw a few cards / generate more card ideas


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Completed Design Treatment
  - Brainstormed more ideas to expand the game prior to balance testing
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Originality, consistency, artistic challenges
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  I tried to reduce the game to a basic set of mechanics which I could build variant cards off of, and this was much more successful
  -  Instead of trying to come up with a bunch of nuance in the gameplay, I reduced the gameplay elements to a few types, and then found inspiration for cards which could vary the interactions of the primitive objects

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- While I don't know how the balancing will work yet, keeping things "simple" has definitely helped my design process
- It doesn't have to be super complex to be fun, it just has to be consistent and well-thought <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  I still have to think about balance and gameplay loops. while it's a little more clear in my mind now, I still think adding too much variation or not restricting the number of player actions could get out of hand
-  How can I balance player actions without making them feel restricted?

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  I have to keep designing the cards and establish what the core types will do. The basic fighting styles and the common ember cards are first.
-  Once I start to build up that base, I can actually test the game.
