#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
  - Researching a lot about availability of namespaces and trademarks will be important if I want to creat my own studio, as being fully original is difficult
  - I'm not sure how much detail should go into these, so I want to look at other examples to get a better idea of how I should format a log

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
  - I will try to better organize my GitHub and familiarize myself with more of its features now that I have gotten the basics
