<!-- Repeat the below as needed-->
### Date: [04/15/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Continue Testing Game mechanics
- [ ] Think about applications for digital prototype

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Playtested the game more times, and with more people.<!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Balancing difficulty, turn time, player hand balance
  - Thinking about applications for digital prototype, defining an order for resolving cascading effects 
    <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - Scaling health as player choice, as opposed to set values, to define how long the rounds will take as well as how difficult <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Balancing the turns is more than just adding cards, sometimes synergy can continue to pile up and make the game last longer
<!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I think I will have to design a script with a defined system to check for all possible cascade events in each instance, but I'm still grasping the scale.
- Considering making internal "phases" and attributes that will have connected functions that I can call together and force into a queue, such as the universal "burn" and "discard" functions

<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Going to continue testing, and begin coding some prototype features
