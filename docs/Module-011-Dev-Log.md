#### Goals for this Module

- [ ] Finish the Game Prototype
- [ ] Do the Demo video
- [ ] Pass the Class

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I've gotten a bunch of the functionality of the game working, with the player hands, cards, and locations working
  -  
- **Challenges faced**:
  - I had a bunch of trouble organizing the data structures, deciding how to split up the functions, and maintaining the player order

- **Solutions**:
  - Honestly, I restarted the scene a few times. I kept trying to manage too many parts at once, and my best solution came taking it in very small steps

#### Learnings
- Tackling the furthest problems isn't always the right way to look ahead. Sometimes it's just build reliable basics to build upon/

#### Free Thinking
- I'm still having trouble making the cascading effects, so i'm wondering if i should create a separate "sub" phase system like how i define Fire fights, so that there's more regular jumps between effects

#### Next Steps
- Keep improving on the design, and then record the demo for sunday

- Thanks for a great semester!
