#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate -->
- [ ] Continue Iterating Prototype
- [ ] Prepare for prototype presentation
- [ ] Consider future aspects for digital 


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - With the extra time before my prototype presentation, I added more cards and extended some mechanics, and was able to test them 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Continuing to playtest brought up some more edge cases and general considerations for broader rulesm such as health adjustment with difficulty and the ability to reroll a draw card or two
  - Scaling for players is presenting some additional issues, of downtime for non-dueling players and health <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
- **Solutions**:
  - I changed/added some card mechanics to address this issue, but I will need more playtesting to work in a permanent rule

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  Some ideas are simply to difficult to balance, and can be broken up as different kinds of cards and effects to implement the ideas without breaking the balance<!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I'm thinking about adding a second Aggressor Token for higher Player count, such that when 5-6 players would exit the rouind phase, the majority aren't just sitting and waiting. I haven't tested this yet, since I have been focused on balancing for 3-4, but it is definitely something I'm considering for higher scales <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Keep adding to the card base, keep testing for new strategies and balance, and try with more players
-  I also need to start considering how the game will run in the digital, as the mechanics I have established have simple concepts, but I have to make sure the chaining of effects acts in the way that I want.<!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
